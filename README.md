#Stock Market Forecasting in the Digital Age: Comparing Classical Statistical Models with Deep Learning Approaches for Financial Time Series Analysis
# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project involves predicting the stock prices of a company using historical data and deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The analysis and modeling are done using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Collect and preprocess historical stock market data.
- Perform data visualization to understand trends and seasonality.
- Train an LSTM-based deep learning model to predict future stock prices.
- Evaluate the model using various metrics.
- Visualize predictions against actual stock prices.

## 🔄 Data Preprocessing

- Removed missing values and normalized data.
- Created lag features for time-series modeling.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

---

## 🧠 Model: LSTM Neural Network

- LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suitable for time series data.
- The model was trained to learn long-term dependencies in stock price trends.

---

## 📊 Evaluation

- Compared actual vs predicted prices using:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- Visual plots to show model performance.

---

## 📌 Results

- The LSTM model was able to capture general stock price trends.
- Predictions followed the shape of actual data with some limitations in precision.
- Great learning on deep learning for time-series forecasting!
